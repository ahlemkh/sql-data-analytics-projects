# Layoffs SQL Data Cleaning and Analysis

This project focuses on end-to-end data preparation and exploratory analysis of a real-world tech layoffs dataset using SQL. It includes two main stages:

1. **Data Cleaning** ‚Äì Preparing the raw dataset for analysis by handling duplicates, formatting inconsistencies, null values, and more.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Äì Extracting key insights on layoffs trends across years, companies, industries, countries, and funding status.

## üß† About the Dataset

**Source:** Collected from platforms like Bloomberg, TechCrunch, NYTimes, and others.  
**Date Range:** From the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic (March 11, 2020) to April 21, 2025.  
**Focus:** The dataset tracks tech layoffs as companies respond to economic slowdowns, interest rate changes, and reduced consumer spending.

Examples of major layoff events include:

- Meta laying off 13% of its workforce (11,000+ employees)
- Similar actions across major tech firms like Amazon, Google, and Salesforce

This dataset is well-suited for analyzing the impact of global crises on the tech sector workforce.
